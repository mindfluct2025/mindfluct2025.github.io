Artificial intelligence (AI) systems have increasingly demonstrated their promise in assisting and enhancing various design processes, such as service, product, engineering, and UI/UX design. Within the human-computer interaction (HCI) community, significant research attention has been directed towards understanding human interaction with AI and ways to improve it. While this research direction is undoubtedly important, HCI researchers should also focus on how AI can directly accelerate innovation across various design domains to positively impact both society and industry. Currently, much of this research centers heavily on generative AI, but there is a need in HCI to push beyond these boundaries.

This workshop aims to provide HCI researchers at CHI a space to broaden their perspectives on AI in design and inspire impactful, forward-thinking research. By gathering insights and experiences from design researchers and practitioners across diverse fields, we hope to foster deep reflection on best practices, opportunities, challenges, and future visions for AI in design. The workshop will feature a keynote talk, multiple lightning talks, and structured activities and discussions.
