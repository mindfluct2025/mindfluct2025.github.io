  <h1>Mindful	Value Creation and Destruction	</h1>
  <h2>Unpacking the Complexity of Design Practice in Human-Data Interaction </h2>

  <p>
  Design doesn’t always solve. Sometimes it deceives. Sometimes it harms. Sometimes the cost is hidden in the process.
  </p>  
  <p>
  This full-day workshop aims to deepen our understanding of the complexities of design practice in relation to value creation and destruction within Human-Data Interaction. We will explore how design decisions shape particular versions of reality and navigate inherent value conflicts, while envisioning the future of mindful value destruction in human data interaction.
  </p>
  <p>
  The session will be highly participatory and immersive. You share personal narratives involving catastrophic oversights, design failures, ethical dilemmas, and overlooked consequences in human-data interaction. Together, we will reshape the meaning and way of value creation and destruction, transform insights into forward-thinking and provocative concepts, and engage in collective discussion.
  </p>
  <p>
  If this sounds like your kind of challenge, please send a 1- to 2-page position paper or case studies, outlining your experience with data-driven value destruction in design research or projects to b.l.lee@exeter.ac.uk by xx June 2025 (TBD).
