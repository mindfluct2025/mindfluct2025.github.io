For the workshop, we will develop a bespoke tool: a deck of Confession Cards, which will be further co-designed with the participants during the session. This added tangibility means the session will become highly participatory and immersive. As outlined in Table 1, to collectively design pathways for Mindful Value Creation and Destruction in Human-Data Interaction, we will guide participants through the following three key activities:

      color: #f0f0f0;
      margin: 0;

      line-height: 1.6;
    }

    .container {
      max-width: 900px;
      margin: 0 auto;
    }

    .activity-card {
      background-color: #1a1c22;
      border-radius: 12px;
      box-shadow: 0 6px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6);

      <h2 class="activity-title">Activity 1 – Collecting Honest Dialogue to Challenge the Narrative of Design as a Driver of Value Creation</h2>
      <p>
        To create a safe space for authentic public discourse that moves beyond the incomplete narratives of value creation and innovation,
        we will introduce the design installation and website for <strong>‘Design. Regret. Confess’</strong> so that participants will share
        personal narratives encompassing catastrophic oversights, ethical dilemmas, and moments of shame using the blank Confession Cards.
        This collective reflection will highlight design’s potential for both success and failure in Human-Data Interaction.

    <div class="activity-card">
      <h2 class="activity-title">Activity 2 – Encouraging Critical Self-Reflection and Public Discourse Focusing on Value Destruction in Human-Data Interaction</h2>
      <p>
        Building on the collected insights and challenges of complex design practice, we will adopt
        <strong>Gigamapping techniques</strong> and a deck of Confession Cards to better understand how particular versions of reality are constructed
        for specific purposes within Human-Data Interaction, and how designers make decisions when faced with inherent value conflicts during
        design and data practices (i.e., capturing, transforming, and communicating information). This approach will encourage a critical
        examination of the various forms of social, ethical, moral, and experiential value destruction.

    <div class="activity-card">
      <h2 class="activity-title">Activity 3 – Envisioning the Future of Value Destruction in Human-Data Interaction</h2>
      <p>
        For this final activity, we will introduce <strong>speculative design</strong> as a method for transforming the insights from
        Activities 1 and 2 into forward-thinking, provocative concepts. Participants will form small groups to collaboratively envision
        novel tools, methods, and future scenarios that address and mitigate the tensions between value creation and destruction.

Our approach combines customized tools to create a space for critical and creative discussion on the relationships between stakeholders, systemic trade-offs, and potential unintended consequences in developing pathways toward responsible More-than-Generative AI Innovation in the HCI-design field.
