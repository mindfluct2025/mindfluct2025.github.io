**Boyeun Lee** is an Assistant Professor in Design and Innovation at the University of Exeter Business School. Her research focuses on design-led digital innovation, emphasizing the use of big data and machine learning to create innovative products, services, and design processes.

**Leah Chong** is a Postdoctoral Associate in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at MIT. In Spring 2025, she will join the Walker Department of Mechanical Engineering at UT Austin as an Assistant Professor. Her research centers on human-AI collaboration in engineering design, computational design methods, and human-centered design.

**Michael Stead** is a Lecturer in Sustainable Design Futures at Lancaster Universityâ€™s School of Design and Imagination Research Lab. His interdisciplinary research explores the systemic opportunities and challenges of data-driven technologies (e.g., AI, IoT) for achieving climate goals like Net Zero and Circular Economies. Blending Design and HCI, he employs Speculative, More-than-Human, and Participatory Design approaches to support communities and industries in adopting sustainable, equitable data-driven technologies and practices.

**Jongmo Kim** is an AI Lead Engineer at Powertask. He holds a Ph.D. in Industrial Engineering, specialising in knowledge graph representation learning. His main interests include LLM-based agent systems integrated with knowledge graphs for knowledge modelling, such as GraphRAG and other KG-based AI applications.

**Chris Speed FRSE** is a Professor of Design for Regenerative Futures at RMIT in Melbourne, Australia. He collaborates with diverse communities and partners to explore how design can support the transition to a regenerative society. Previously, he was a pivotal figure in establishing the Institute for Design Informatics at the University of Edinburgh, which developed advanced methods for designing from, with, and by data.
