    <h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>With the recent advancement in data-driven computational techniques, such as deep learning, there has been a growing interest in developing and implementing artificial intelligence (AI) systems, particularly generative AI, for various design applications. This interest is evident given the immense bodies of related research that are emerging in the human-computer interaction (HCI) communities, with no exception to CHI. Just over the past five years, CHI published about 800 research articles that include the keyword “artificial intelligence,” 358 of which were published only this year. Furthermore, numerous CHI workshops focused on AI-related topics have appeared in recent years.</p>

<p>This expansive interest in AI and design is resulting in the surge of new AI-driven techniques, methods, and tools that are rapidly transforming the design landscape and fostering product and service innovation [22]. Design practices are beginning to become disrupted, replaced, or complemented by new technology, and the roles of designers and design researchers are taking their new shape. However, the impact upon different sub-disciplines of design is not consistent. For instance, in product-service development, using AI to analyze big data has been helping to foster the creation of novel service concepts [17, 25] and enhance design efficiency by integrating users, products, services, and production processes [3, 20]. Such impact can ultimately lead to product innovation [19, 21] and contribute to value generation [18, 23, 33]. In contrast, in engineering design, AI systems have been implemented in various steps of the design process, from user research and ideation [4, 6, 36, 40, 42] to simulation and manufacturing [12, 14, 31, 39]. Many of these systems are not only integrated as mere tools but also sometimes as autonomous teammates and process managers [10, 11], leading to significant changes in the engineering design practice and the role of human designers. Consequently, in HCI, the interaction between human designers and AI systems has become a key research area [24], and more attention is required to extend HCI’s understanding of the nuanced implications of AI across different design disciplines.</p>

<p>Despite this growing momentum around AI, we observe certain challenges and limitations in the current AI-focused design research in the HCI community. One of them is an unmatched amount of work focused on generative AI that is used in various design domains to assist human designers’ divergent thinking by facilitating efficient exploration of the design space. In the past year, CHI published 143 research articles that match the keywords “generative AI,” “genAI,” or “gen-AI,” which made up about 40% of “artificial intelligence”-related articles (n=358). While research across various design disciplines has explored diverse roles, impacts, and challenges of AI in multiple design stages and purposes, the HCI community’s focus seems to have been around generative AI. Moreover, much prior work in HCI has focused on designing for AI rather than designing/using AI for design [24]. The latter has been studied mostly in specific disciplines, such as UI/UX [24], engineering [9], and product-service systems [26], and only a few studies have taken a holistic approach to understanding the opportunities and challenges of using AI across different design disciplines, particularly in driving innovation throughout the various stages of design.</p>

<p>Given the gaps and challenges, we believe it is critical for HCI design researchers to broaden their perspectives beyond the obvious use of AI technology and its associated norms and assumptions. Not only this, but they will benefit from gaining a clear and comprehensive understanding of the opportunities and challenges of AI over the course of the entire innovation process in various design domains. Therefore, the purpose of this workshop is to foster discussions to broaden the scope of perspectives and understanding in HCI design research by bringing in design experts with different backgrounds and posing topics on different types of trade-offs in human-AI collaboration in design. By the end of the workshop, we hope to collectively develop a framework for AI in the entire innovation design process and identify gaps in knowledge to establish a productive research agenda.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-objectives-and-themes">WORKSHOP OBJECTIVES AND THEMES</h2>

<p>In this workshop, we aim to better understand AI-driven innovation by synthesizing both published and unpublished works to establish best practices, identify challenges, and outline future research directions for using AI in design. To achieve this goal, we will explore the following topics and themes through the application of speculative design [8], participatory design [34], and systemic design [7] techniques to concretize pathways for developing More-than-Generative AI Innovation Futures:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Understanding the Landscape of AI Applications in Design Research</strong>: What are the best practices for design researchers when using AI in their projects or when studying it? (e.g., What are the commonalities and differences in the effective use of AI across different design disciplines? How could AI transform design practices across different phases of the design innovation process?)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Comprehending the Challenges and Trade-offs in Human-AI Collaboration</strong>: What are the challenges and trade-offs in implementing AI systems in design processes that design researchers must address or balance? (e.g., Novelty vs. Feasibility; Efficiency vs. Learning; Trust vs. Ownership; Time-consuming vs. Accuracy; Transparency vs. Usability; Automation vs. Control; Scalability vs. Cost)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Envisioning the Future of AI in Design Research</strong>: What roles will AI potentially play in driving innovation? (e.g., How can data-driven systems enhance, rather than diminish, design? What impacts might AI bring? How do the use and expectations of AI for design innovation vary across different design disciplines? How might we be supported by AI tools across the design innovation process?)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Establishing Research Agenda for AI-Driven Innovation in Design Research</strong>: How can design researchers synthesize and outline a comprehensive research agenda to ensure the empirically sound application of AI in design innovation? How might we bridge the gap between the challenges and expectations of AI for innovation?</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>We believe CHI to be the ideal venue to address these questions due to the diverse attendees encompassing various AI-related topics, methodologies, and disciplines. The prevalence of HCI research on human-AI collaboration will align well with the community’s growing emphasis on responsible and sustainable AI for design innovation. Insights from this workshop can also contribute to other research communities grappling with similar questions.</p>
